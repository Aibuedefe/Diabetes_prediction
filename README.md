# Diabetes_prediction
This repository contains code and resources for predicting diabetes using machine learning. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either having diabetes or not based on certain features.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is on Kaggle. It consists of several medical predictor variables, such as glucose level, blood pressure, and body mass index, along with the target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the predictive model:

Copy code
jupyter notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb
or

Copy code
python diabetes_prediction.py
The notebook/script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train a machine learning models ( Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM), and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.

Results
The results of the prediction model will be displayed in the notebook/script's output. It will include various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the model in predicting diabetes.

Contributing
Contributions to improve the project are welcome. If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
